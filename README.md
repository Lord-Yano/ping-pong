# PING PONG Game
This is ping pong game based purely on the python programming language.
Made use of the turtle module to take care of the basic graphics.

## Game window
Created window with dimensions 800px wide by 600px high.

## Paddle animations and settings
Created a file that handles the paddle animations and settings.
Created the ball used in the ping pong games.
Created screen boundaries so that the ball is not displaced outside the screen.

## Errors
The ball is not being animated from its own module. Has to be initiated from the paddles mod.
